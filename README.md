# BookTunes
The project is based on flutter, which needs to be installed locally. (https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

For the Spotify Integration it is also necessary to add a .env file to the base of the project and add the following parameters:
CLIENT_ID=XXXXXXX
REDIRECT_URL=XXXXXXX
SECRET=XXXXXX

Where the XXXXXX are replaced with the client id, redirect url and secret created in the spotify developer program. (https://developer.spotify.com/)

To build the project Android Studio as well as XCode (only on MacOS) need to be installed to build the apps for Android and iOS respectively.
The chosen project tags need to be set in the spotify developer program according to the project settings for the iOS and Android projects, other wise Spotify will not authorize the connections.

After all this setup is done, the project can be built in Android Studio or XCode or with the command "flutter run" while a device is connected to the computer.
